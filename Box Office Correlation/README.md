When asked how movie executives know if their movie would make money or not, Hollywood-legend William Goldman once said,

"Nobody knows anything."

But surely there are independent variables that are more correlated with box office than others. I was personally motivated to find this out: I'm a filmmaker too, and I'd much rather make money than lose money with my movie.

So my goal was to analyze the Pearson Correlation Coefficients to determine just how correlated each independent variable is with a movie's gross revenue, in hopes of one day replicating the box office success of movies I love.

The "Movie Data.zip" file contains 3 different csv files. "Comprehensive IMDb Data.csv" is the most complete and should be used. The other two are simply there for proof of feature engineering (relevant only to recruiters).
